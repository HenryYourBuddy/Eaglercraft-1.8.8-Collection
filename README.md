# Eaglercraft-1.8.8-Collection
This collection contains texture packs, ui and (gui coming soon) packs to Eaglercraft. All of these packs came from direct websites and are carefully inspected with antiviruses and using a VM. It contains the HTML file itself, along with the resource packs, and the zip for the HTML file to easily send it compressed.

I am not affiliated with Eaglercraft or its devs, and i do not make hacked clients, you can go look for them around the internet but you will not get them from me sadly.

Eaglercraft is a great project full of really talented individuals that i do respect. I enjoy playing eaglercraft in my freetime, and i hope people shall do the same too.

also, i am not afflited with mojang.

have fun
